      <p className="mb-6">
        <strong>PneumEvolve</strong> is a living experiment in conscious community-building.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        It begins here, in Vernon, BC — with gardens, people, and the simple truth that <em>we are stronger together</em>. Our mission is to reawaken the natural sovereignty of the individual while nurturing cooperative systems that meet our shared needs: food, shelter, belonging, and purpose.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        We are not waiting for governments or corporations to save us. We are not here to compete. We are here to <strong>build</strong>, together.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">🌿 What Is PneumEvolve?</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Garden Blitzes</strong>: spontaneous teams that help each other build gardens, share food, and regenerate land.</li>
        <li><strong>Mutual Aid</strong>: a simple way for neighbors to post what they need and what they can offer — from a bag of potatoes to a spare room.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Voting</strong>: collective decisions on how to govern our spaces, distribute resources, and evolve together.</li>
        <li><strong>Event Planning</strong>: tools to organize potlucks, work bees, skillshares, and town hall gatherings.</li>
        <li><strong>Communal Living Tools</strong>: connect people looking to co-create homes, share space, and live with intention.</li>
        <li><strong>Token & Reputation Systems</strong> (optional): earn and exchange local tokens like SEED for community contributions — or track abundance without currency at all.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        <em>These features are not all live yet — they’re what we are working toward.</em> PneumEvolve is an unfolding blueprint, and you're invited to help shape it.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">🔁 The Core Philosophy</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>You are valuable because you exist.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>We are not meant to live in isolation.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>We can design better systems — starting now.</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        PneumEvolve is for those who are tired of waiting for permission to live differently. For those who know that play, cooperation, and love are more natural than hustle, competition, and fear.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        We don’t have all the answers — and that’s the point. We are building this <strong>together</strong>, as a community. It’s editable, organic, and always evolving.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">🛠️ What We're Building — Together</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        The following features are part of the roadmap — some are functional, some are still in development. Your participation helps make them real:
      </p>

      <p className="mb-2 font-semibold">Soon, anyone will be able to:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Create or join a local community node (like "PneumEvolve Vernon")</li>
        <li>Post needs or offers</li>
        <li>Vote on collective decisions</li>
        <li>Organize or attend events</li>
        <li>Build and share resources</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-2 font-semibold">Admins (like Shea) will be able to:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Edit the community’s values, vision, and modules</li>
        <li>Propose tools like SEED tokens or food distribution hubs</li>
        <li>Connect real-world action with digital coordination</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">🌍 The Long-Term Dream</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        What starts in Vernon can ripple outward. We imagine a world filled with connected, self-organizing communities — each one sovereign, yet collaborating freely. A global web of local abundance.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        And it begins right here. With you. With us.
      </p>

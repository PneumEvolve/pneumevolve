          <strong>1. Observer Effect (Quantum Physics):</strong> Subatomic particles exist in a state
          of probability until observedâ€”meaning conscious observation affects physical reality.
          Your awareness plays a direct role in shaping what becomes real.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Reticular Activating System (RAS):</strong> Your brain filters reality based on
          beliefs. What you believe determines what you noticeâ€”and what you act onâ€”so changing your
          beliefs reshapes your reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Resonance and Frequency:</strong> Thoughts and emotions carry energy. High
          frequencies like joy and gratitude create resonance with higher possibilities, aligning you
          with outcomes that match your vibration.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">ðŸŒŽ Collective Manifestation & Timeline Shifting</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Shared Quantum Field:</strong> When many people hold the same intention, the
          signal to the quantum field amplifies. Collective resonance can tip global outcomes toward
          a shared vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Morphic Fields (Sheldrake):</strong> Behaviors and ideas become easier to adopt
          across space and time once a critical mass engages with them. Belief in peace makes peace
          more likely to occur elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Real-Time Timeline Rewriting:</strong> Time is not fixed at the quantum level.
          Collective intention can shift the dominant timeline in real-time, resulting in mass
          awakening, sudden system changes, and planetary evolution.

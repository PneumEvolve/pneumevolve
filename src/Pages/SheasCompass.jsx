        I Am Always Changing. That is the only constant. But through my changes I have noticed some Truths that I cannot deny. These are those Truths:
      </p>

      <div className="space-y-6 text-xl">
        <p>‚ú® <strong>I Am.</strong> The awareness behind all things. The breath. The presence. The source.</p>

        <p>üåç <strong>We Are.</strong> No soul exists alone. We are strands of one infinite thread. What I do to you, I do to me.</p>

        <p>‚ù§Ô∏è <strong>Love Is the Most Powerful Force in the Universe.</strong> Love is the original vibration. The creative fire. The memory of home.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">A Living Philosophy</h2>

        <p>
          I believe we are each sparks of the infinite, remembering ourselves in form. There is no single path, no one-size-fits-all truth. But there are patterns‚Äîechoes‚Äîof something deeper beneath all our stories.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe Earth is alive and listening. That we are not separate from Her, but part of Her dreaming.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe that healing doesn‚Äôt come from escaping the world, but by fully embracing it‚Äîwith open eyes, an open heart, and clean hands.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe we came here to remember that we are free.
